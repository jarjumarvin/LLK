Ready to test your Korean skills? We have a Placement Test for you to see where you are.

It has **three portions** and will take about **45 minutes** to complete.
This three-part exam will test your speaking, reading comprehension, and writing through prompts and multiple choice questions.
When you are ready, PM a **<span style="color:blue">Mentor</span>**  (who is online and active) to take the test.

**We recommend at least six months of studying before you take the test.**

Students who are placed into “Advanced” have typically studied Korean for about 2-3 years.
There are three placements:

**<span style="color:Plum ">씨앗 (Beginner)</span>** - about 0-40% correct
**<span style="color:RebeccaPurple ">새싹 (Intermediate)</span>** - about 40-77% correct
**<span style="color:purple">나무 (Advanced)</span>** - about 77%+ correct

This is meant for you to **assess your knowledge** and **receive feedback from mentors**. Don’t be afraid to see where you are - even an **<span style="color:purple">나무 (Advanced)</span>** level student can improve their Korean knowledge, and we hope that this is an opportunity for beginner level students to receive feedback and grow. :-)
