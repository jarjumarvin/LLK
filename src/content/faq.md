# Q: How do I learn Korean?

One day at a time. But learn to **read Hangul** first. (See [Hangul Resources](https://jarjumarvin.github.io/LLK/resources-hangul.html))

Then **continue practicing reading and listen a lot** - whether that be songs, or kdrama, or entertainment shows.
Lots of **listening, lots of reading out loud**. Try to speak at any chance you get. **Write**. Have people critique it.

Get out there and just practice. We’re here to help :)

# Q: What are the numbers next to nicknames?

Because Korean conjugations often (but not always) depend on the **age of the people involved**, some members display their **birth year** on their nickname.
Someone will probably ask you your age or birth year when you engage in a Korean conversation both in real life and on the Discord server, so be prepared!

While this is **not mandatory**, making your age explicit will give hint at how you will speak to / others will hold a conversation with you.

Of course, regardless of ages, everyone on the server is expected to treat each other with respect.

# Q. Are there native Koreans on this server?

Yes, quite a handful.

Most of them have a dark green **'native'** tag. They usually come to life around 11pm Korea time and take over the server before going to bed.

# Q. Who are the bots and what do they do?

## @Lilium#5847

The precious daughter of RayderBlitz and the princess of the server.
Her hobbies include helping people with various tasks like granting titles that open up doors to new possibilities.

Type in **“>help”** to learn more.

## @FredBoat♪♪#7284 and @Dyno#3861

The **DJs of #karaoke**. They turn the discs (youtube links) and tables (playlist) for you to have a rockin’ time in #karaoke. Woo!

**(we suggest turning down its volume to around 10% beforehand..)**

# Q. Who is Ho and how many languages does he speak?

Ho is a ~~unicorn~~ kind mentor on the server. He speaks five languages comfortably (Korean, English, Spanish, Japanese, something else).
He’s very good with linguistics & technical stuff about languages.

If you’ve got an unconventional or technical question, he’s the one to go to!

## Oh, so, is Ho a linguistics major?

**Nope.**

# Q. How many people are self-taught? How many people have taken a class?

Because Korean isn’t necessarily a popular and major language, it’s not easy to find places that offer classes. Due to this, many of our members are self-taught.
Of course, at the same time, we will also have folks who have taken classes at schools, at Korean schools (어학당), and even full-out Korean majors in their respective universities.

So… We can’t give you an exact number, but we have both! **And yes, it’s possible to learn Korean just by yourself**.

No, just because you take classes, that doesn’t mean that you’ll be better off than self-taught folks.
**It comes down to consistency and effort :)**

# Q. Is Korean like Japanese?

The simple answer to this question is, **“urm, kinda.”**

Compared to English, the grammar structure of Korean is a lot similar to Japanese. With China as a big cultural and linguistic neighbor, both languages share some linguistic influences from China (i.e. Korean’s Hanja, Japanese’s Kanji).

You will **probably** find Korean easier if you’ve had some experience learning Japanese, due to those similarities.

**However**, they do not share the same roots… Nor are they the same language. It’s like comparing “Is English and Spanish the same language?”.
You will not get far into the language if you constantly compare Korean to Japanese.

We just hope that you take interest in Korean for Korean sake ;)

**Go! Billy’s** video explains these similarities and differences thoroughly. (See [Are Korean and Japanese related languages?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBrTltT47Vk))
