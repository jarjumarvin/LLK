We have a few rules and guidelines in place to promote a respectful learning environment.

If you're just here to see the different roles available on the discord click [here](https://jarjumarvin.github.io/LLK/discord-rules-roles.html#roles).

## Rules

* Treat each other with respect!

* We do NOT tolerate NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content, racism or any other malicious, or pirated content!

* Don't advertise without permission!

* Don't spam!

* The usage of private bots is prohibited

* Don't ask for personal information like (e.g. IDs, phone numbers)

* Listen to staff members, if they tell you to stop, do stop. If you believe you have been treated unfairly, you may appeal to an Admin.

## Guidelines

* Use your common sense. We don't want to start writing paragraphs here, so we wont list everything in the rules. If you cause problems on the server you may get banned even if you "didnt break any rules"

* Act maturely, we don't need teenage drama etc. in here.

* The rules apply to PMs as well, if it is brought to our attention that someone is spamming, asking for personal information or somehow else breaking our rules, we preserve the right to take action.

* Try to keep learning channels about learning topics. Occasional off topic posts are OK, but lengthy conversations not about learning should be in their appropriate channel.

* Please do not post pirated material

# Roles

## Staff

* <span style="color:red">Admin</span> - they're the top brass authority-wise and will have the final call
* <span style="color:orange">Moderator</span> - they're there to keep the peace within the server
* <span style="color:blue">Mentor</span> - they're there to assist with learning the language, you can ask them if you can’t figure something out

## Non-Staff

* <span style="color:LightSkyBlue">Potential Mentor</span> - they're not quite staff yet, but as the name says, they might become Mentors in the future
* <span style="color:darkgreen">Native</span> - they're korean natives and will in most cases be the more reliable source

* Muted - this role is for people who did not adhere to the server's rules. Voice- and text chat mute will be applied for a certain time. If you didn't get unmuted after your mute period ended PM a staff member.
* <span style="color:gold">BEST HANGOOLER</span> - These people have won some kind of contest on the server! This doesn’t exactly measure their korean skills, but it does show a level of dedication and fun ;)

* Classroom (self-assignable) - assign yourself this role to get a notification for staff (usually mentor) led activities in #classroom
* Lessons (self-assignable) - assign yourself this role to get a notification for voice lessons (usually in Classroom | 교실 with #classroom_voice as text supplement)

## Various

The **bots** have their own respective roles.

Various "In Voice Chat" roles that give you access to a text supplement channel when you're in the respective voice channel.
E.g. when you join the #Karaoke | 노래방 voice channel you'll get the "In Karaoke Voice Chat" role, giving you access to the #karaoke text channel
