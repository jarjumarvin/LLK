# Activities

## Word of the Day (#classroom)

~~Everyday, a Mentor will post a “Word of the Day” and some related vocabulary words! You are welcome to write a sentence for practice.
We will help you with proper spelling and spacing and explain any grammatical questions you have. Even if you don’t want to write a sentence, feel free to ask questions about the words and sentences that others post. You could even try to translate them!~~

**currently Word of the Day is on indefinite hiatus. ㅠ.ㅠ**
**Want to see an archive of all past WotDs? Go [here](https://gongbu4life.tumblr.com/).**

## Reading & Listening (#classroom)

Every week (or so), a Mentor will post an **article** to read and listen to.
The materials can range from news to interviews, or even about KPOP or video games. They will likely be a written literature with a reading; or a audio/video with a transcript.
